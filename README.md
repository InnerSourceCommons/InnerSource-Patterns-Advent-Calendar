# InnerSource Patterns / Advent Calendar

An advent calendar for 2025, to highlight InnerSource patterns that need your help!

## TODO

- create content for the calendar / e.g. pick patterns from [this list](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues/772) that could be improved
- (optional) hide days until that day is reached i.e. only once we reach December 1st, 2025 the 1st "door" in the advent calendar can be opened
- **(done)** create individual URLs for each day (so that we can share individual days on social media etc)

## Assessment for my use case

Advantages:

- a single HTML file that we need to edit to populate it with the content that we want to show
- runs on GitHub pages (i.e. no other hosting requirements)

Drawbacks:

- all days of the calendar are shown immediately / i.e. even on December 1st one could already click all days of the advent calendar. I could actually live with this.
- the days don't have individual URLs. i.e. if we share this on social media we cannot point to individual days / little bit annoying
